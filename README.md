## Overview

In this DevChallenge, I tasked myself with making a responsive 404 webpage, which can be found <a href="https://nikhil404devchallenge.netlify.app">
      here
    </a>. I decided to use HTML5 and CSS3 to practice fundamentals. The design relies on CSS Grid for layout and google fonts for, well, fonts.
